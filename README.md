# Seq2Seq Chatbot with TensorFlow.js

A simple dumb chat bot that can be built upon. Because of the easy to use interface, I personally use this for training before deploying the model to bots connected to services.

### How to run

1. Find data to train on and upload data into files stored in the `data` folder.
   **_Starting out, you will have the default sarcasm QA dataset._**
2. Create a venv using python3 and install the requirements
3. Run `train.py` in the venv.
   **_(I personally use google collab with GPU enabled since I don't have a good GPU to accelerate training)_**
4. `cd` into the `js` folder and install the dependencies.
5. Start the program by running npm start
